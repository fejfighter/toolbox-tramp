* Toolbox over TRAMP
** specifically toolbox support

Access Toolbox containers found on Fedora Silverblue (and workstation Fedora if you create them)

Inspired by docker-tramp, but largely diverged at this point.
Using `podman` directly, with some knowledge of toolbox, to access rootless (pet) containers with tramp.
This means container commands will run as a user and not as root, just like using `toolbox enter`

** Finding a file inside a container:

#+begin_src 
/toolbox:<container>:path/to/file
#+end_src

The `<container>` flag is entirely optional and will select the default created toolbox container (`fedora-container-36`) if one exists.

** Installation
*** Straight
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package toolbox-tramp
    :straight (toolbox-tramp :type git
			     :host github
			     :repo "fejfighter/toolbox-tramp"))
#+end_src
